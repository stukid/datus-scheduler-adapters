# Required Checks

This repository owns the primary correctness signal for Datus scheduler adapter
packages. Datus-agent nightly consumes this repository as a cross-repository
integration signal, but it does not replace this repository's own required
checks.

The status context names below are GitHub ruleset contracts. Keep workflow names
and job names stable, or update the ruleset and this document in the same change.

## PR Required Checks

- `Adapter CI / unit-tests`

PR checks must stay deterministic and avoid scheduler service startup. They
protect unit correctness, package import paths, registry behavior, and cheap
adapter contracts.

## Merge Queue Required Checks

- `Adapter CI / unit-tests`
- `Adapter CI / integration-tests`

`Adapter CI / integration-tests` is intentionally limited to `merge_group` and
manual dispatch. It starts Airflow-backed integration and validates submit,
trigger, poll, and read-back behavior before code reaches `main`.

## Bypass Policy

Bypass should be reserved for CI bootstrap or incident recovery. A bypass merge
should explain the reason in the PR or a follow-up issue, then restore the
required checks as soon as the repository can validate normally again.
